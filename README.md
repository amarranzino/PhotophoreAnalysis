## Data Description:
R script written for analyzing photophore size and distribution patterns in different species. <br/>

All raw data used for these analyses are based on measurements of photophores derived from images of preserved specimens. Raw images and individual measurments for each specimen are found in the "Photophore Size Data Files". Measurments were made using ImageJ Software. <br/>

Raw measurment data for all specimnes examined is found in the file "Stomiiform_Photophore_Dat_20250729.csv". <br/>

The R script used to generate summary statistics and data visualizations is found in the "Photophore_AnalysesandPlots.R" file. <br/>

The R script generates summary data, including summaries of values grouped by specimen, species, and region. These values are exported into an excel file "Photo_Data.xls". Each tab contains the following information:

- **avg_photo_area_mm2_tot:** the mean of total area (sum of the areas of photophores of a given type within the caudal region for a given species) occupied by photophores, standardized for fish size. Calculated by dividing photophore area by the standard length of the specimen. Reported as mm2/mm - average area of photophores (in mm2), standardized by fish SL (in mm)
- **sd_photo_area_mm2_tot:** the standard deviation of total areas (sum of the areas of photophores of a given type within the caudal region for a given species) occupied by photophores, standardized for fish size. Calculated by dividing photophore area by the standard length of the specimen. Reported as mm2/mm - average area of photophores (in mm2), standardized by fish SL (in mm)
